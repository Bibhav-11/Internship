# Internship Summary

This repository contains a summary of my work during the internship, highlighting the key projects and concepts I worked on.

## Section 1: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

In this section, I focused on learning and applying Object-Oriented Programming concepts. The main project in this section was the development of an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system.

### Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)

The ERP project was designed to demonstrate my understanding of OOP principles and best practices. Here are some key details about the project:

- **Project Overview**: The ERP system is a comprehensive software solution that integrates various business processes and functions, including inventory management, human resources, finance, and more.

- **Technologies Used**: The project was implemented using [list the technologies, programming languages, or frameworks used].

- **Key Features**:

  - **HR Module:** Manage HR-related tasks, including employee records, payroll, and more.
  - **Finance Module:** Handle financial transactions, invoices, and budget management.
  - **Console Interface:** User-friendly console-based interface for interacting with the ERP system.

- **Applying OOP Principles**:

  - **Encapsulation:** The application uses classes to encapsulate data and behavior for HR, Finance, and other modules, making it easy to manage and maintain their respective functionalities.
  - **Inheritance:** The `Module` base class is inherited by specific modules like HR and Finance, allowing code reuse and providing a common structure for all modules.
  - **Polymorphism:** Each module can have its own implementation of the `Run` method, enabling dynamic behavior based on the specific module selected.
  - **Abstraction:** The use of classes and methods abstracts the underlying complexity, making it easier to work with modules and their associated data.

  By adhering to these principles, the ERP system achieves a modular and extensible architecture that promotes code organization and maintainability.

### Code Samples

You can find code samples related to the ERP project in the `Section 1 - OOP/EnterpriseResourcePlanning` directory within this repository. Feel free to explore the code to get a better understanding of the OOP concepts I applied.
